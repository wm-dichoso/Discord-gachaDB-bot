# Discord-gachaDB-bot
trying to learn python language.

- trying to learn python in developing things. 

- using chat gpt as guide without making it send me actual code to copy and paste

- convenience ? if i actually finish the project?

idea: a discord bot written in python
- store some data (gacha pulls data like game name, current pity on banners, ssr pull history) in a text or json file on computer. ended up using sqlite for easy query purposes
- store the bot to have access to only that channels 
- check channel id for game name
- display on command the pull history for that game in pagination
- display current pity on banners for that game
additional commands:
- session timer start a story session log the time started and end, also put break command when you want to take a break then display total time elapsed on that story session while also including how long the break was.
- create a command that makes new database if we decided to store info on a new game
- do logging on a separate file
